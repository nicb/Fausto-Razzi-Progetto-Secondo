# Fausto Razzi - *Progetto Secondo*

The software needed to build the music composition *Progetto Secondo* by Fausto Razzi.

## Requirements

The `python` code included here requires the `ConfParser` egg which may be
found [here](https://github.com/nicb/ConfParser). You will need to run the 
the `setup.py` script in the `ConfParser` folder to install it properly in the
`python` system environment, otherwise the `python` code written for *Progetto
Secondo* will not run.
